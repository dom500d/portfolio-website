                    This is my first project car, my 2002 BMW e46 325ci. This car started off its life as an automatic, but didn't stay
                    that way for long once I got the car.

                    The actual hardware implementation of this system is done in C++ on ESP32 microcontrollers.
                    Each peripheral system, regardless of the intended use case, contains a relay, a current sensor,
                    a temperature and humidity sensor, and an AC-DC power converter. The ESP32s in the peripherals interface
                    with the center hub of the house, the thermostat, through the MQTT protocol on the user's WiFi network.
                    The thermostat, which is also run with an ESP32, allows the user to change the temperature set-point of the house,
                    as well as individually select which peripheral system's temperature system the user wants to use to set 
                    the temperature.
