        <h1>Hi there!</h1>
        <p>I'm Dominic Orlando, a third year Electrical Engineering major at UC San Diego, specializing in Machine Learning and Controls.
            Outside of academics, I'm involved in a variety of things, including the UCSD Cycling Team, of which I've recently been elected as president.
