                    At a high level, our proprietary system consists of numerous peripheral systems placed throughout 
                    a residence/building. We offer two versions of these peripherals. One specifically for home-builders 
                    or home owners who are comfortable with changing out their outlets, and one specifically for those
                    who, rightfully so, would rather not poke around in their electrical outlets.

                    The actual hardware implementation of this system is done in C++ on ESP32 microcontrollers.
                    Each peripheral system, regardless of the intended use case, contains a relay, a current sensor,
                    a temperature and humidity sensor, and an AC-DC power converter. The ESP32s in the peripherals interface
                    with the center hub of the house, the thermostat, through the MQTT protocol on the user's WiFi network.
                    The thermostat, which is also run with an ESP32, allows the user to change the temperature set-point of the house,
                    as well as individually select which peripheral system's temperature system the user wants to use to set 
                    the temperature.
